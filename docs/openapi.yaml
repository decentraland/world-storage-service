    ## Overview

    World Storage Service provides world-isolated key-value storage with three namespaces:
    - **World Storage**: Global key-value storage scoped to a world (`/values/:key`)
    - **Player Storage**: Per-player key-value storage scoped to both world and player address (`/players/:player_address/values/:key`)
    - **Env Storage**: Encrypted environment variable storage scoped to a world (`/env/:key`)

    All requests must be signed using Decentraland's Signed Fetch (ADR-44); the calling world
    is derived from the signed fetch metadata.
