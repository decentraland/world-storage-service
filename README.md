## API Documentation

The API is fully documented using the [OpenAPI standard](https://swagger.io/specification/). It's schema is located at [docs/openapi.yaml](docs/ai-agent-context.md).

## Database

### Schema

<!-- Remove this section if the service does not have a database -->

See [docs/database-schemas.md](docs/database-schemas.md) for detailed schema, column definitions, and relationships

### Migrations

<!-- Remove this section if the service does not have a database -->

The service uses `node-pg-migrate` for database migrations. These migrations are located in `src/migrations/`. The service automatically runs the migrations when starting up.

#### Create a new migration

Migrations are created by running the create command:

```bash
yarn migrate create name-of-the-migration
```

This will result in the creation of a migration file inside of the `src/migrations/` directory. This migration file MUST contain the migration set up and rollback procedures.

#### Manually applying migrations

If required, these migrations can be run manually.

To run them manually:

```bash
yarn migrate up
```

To rollback them manually:

```bash
yarn migrate down
```
